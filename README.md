# Note
This program allows a user to either create "notecards" from which to quiz 
themselves on, via a CLI, or to create and reference "journal" entries long 
or short. Note that in order for this program to work as-is, the user must
modify the code and set the var 'directory' equal to the path which the 
program resides in.
